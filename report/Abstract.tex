\begin{abstract}
In this thesis work, we propose an alternative to working with relational
databases from inside an object oriented language (in this case Java),
with the goal of having an object oriented, concurrently safe, automatically
persisted means of manipulating data of a complex data model.

We do this by designing and implementing a Java-based runtime, consisting
of a transaction module, a persistence module and an execution module,
all operating on a run-time meta-model, representing the user's data
model. The user's data model is defined in a data definition language
designed for the purpose, and compiled to object oriented Java-code,
utilizing the runtime.

By doing this, we have created a viable alternative to using relational
databases from an object-oriented language. The solution is different
from traditional object-relational mapping solutions, in that it keeps
the whole data model centralized. \end{abstract}
